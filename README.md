# Saluto!
A simple way to give a random way to greet people. 

## Building from source
1. Install [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
2. Build and run the bundler (`esbuild salute.js --bundle --minify --sourcemap --outfile saluto.min.js`)

or:

1. Install [Golang](https://golang.org/dl)
2. Run the bundler (`go run main.go`)

or: Use `saluto.js` directly.

The function will be available for whenever you decide to run it on your browser as `saluto()`.

## FAQ
**Q: Why did you make this?** I wanted to add a tiny gimick to the homepage of [my site.](https://www.doamatto.xyz)<br/>
**Q: Why isn't language X included?** This is the version used on my portfolio, but you can add as many other greetings as you want. This is a very niche tool and meant to be more of a "Look and See" instead of a "deploy on your own" project.
